# NgLibrary

This is a simple app that pretends to be an online gateway into checking out books from your local library. It follows best practices established by community leaders in Angular, RxJS, and beyond (including a tiny bit by me).

Have fun!

## Overview

This Angular app was built to demonstrate as closely as possible to a real Production app. This is open-source, open to all.

To get the app going, start the Angular Development server. 

## Frontend Angular

You'll need to have the LTS of Node installed. The Angular CLI is really capable and will guide if your version doesn't match the requirements. 

Getting started, you need to install the dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

If you haven't already, install Angular's CLI:
```
$ npm i -g @angular/cli
```

You'll need it to run the Angular Development server and build the Production version with AoT.

## Angular Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Angular Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Angular Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running Angular unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running Angular end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further Angular help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

The frontend project's initial commit was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0.
